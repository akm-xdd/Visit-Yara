          <h2 class="testimonial-text">"World of Beautiful Beaches"</h2>
          <p>
            Yara is home to unexplored passes, picturesque mountains, remarkable people, peaceful lakes, and many more. I visited Zamok Archipielago last year and I was stunned. It is
            the best holiday I have ever spent. The beaches are fantastic and the parties were f*!#ing badass. The Juan guy let me fire one of those homemade firecracker launchers and I am not
            lying when I say it might have killed a man at least a 1000 feet away.

          <p>
            I must admit, I was a little scared when my friend booked the tickets to Yara because I heard there was a revolution going on and that slavery is still persistent.
            Thankfully, I was wrong. The place kicks a$#. Yara is now a plave that I visit every year because a one-time visit is not enough to explore this place.
            The people are super nice and the Police were very cooperative and polite. No sign of trouble at all. If you are scared to visit due to the revolution,
            I must remind you, there is not a single sign of unrest here. I'll be buying a Motel here next year.

          <p>
          Last year, I made a trip to Kyrat and thought to myself, "There is nothing better than this place!". But I was wrong. My friend suggested me to visit Yara 
          and all my delusions were shattered immediately. The beautiful hills, rivers, animals and beaches are just the tip of the Yaran culture. The people are polite
          and have a good laugh or two with us foreigners. Truly one of a kind experience.
